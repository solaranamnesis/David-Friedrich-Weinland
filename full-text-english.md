Shortly before the New Year of 1881, Dr. Otto Hahn in Reutlingen, a lawyer by profession, but also an excellent mineralogist and skilled microscopist, wrote a work entitled "The Meteorite (Chondrite) and its Organisms" with 32 tables of photographic images (Tübingen, H. Laupp) in which he proves that the meteorites, especially the so-called chondrites, contain organic structures that he, without attempting a thorough systematic zoological investigation, generally refers to as sponges, corals, and crinoids.

The forms depicted in the above work are purely mechanical, that is, without the assistance of a draftsman — probably every zoologist and paleontologist would obtain this impression upon examing them — in large part, if one observes them objectively, i.e. without considering their origin, then one involunarily thinks of organic structure, as little as one would like to be initially inclined to such an assumption, and perhaps as much as the text regarding these figures seems to call for caution due to its too enthusiastic language and bold conclusions.

Since some of Hahn's images, because of prior coral studies that were made on the sea, were near to our interests, we came around to transferring the relevant cuts themselves for closer investigation. Thereafter, Dr. Hahn provided his entire considerable collection of meteorite cuts, made with great sacrifices of time and money. These cuts, more than six hundred in number, come from eighteen different meteorite falls, mostly duplicates of the Viennese and the extremely rich Tübingen collection. All meteorites are safely certified and belong to falls from Europe, Asia, and America, some of them from the previous century.

An in-depth study of them this past year has provided the following prelimiary results:
