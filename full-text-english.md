Laupp) in which he proves that the meteorites, especially the so-called chondrites, contain organic structures that he, without attempting a thorough systematic zoological investigation, generally refers to as sponges, corals, and crinoids.

The forms depicted in the above work are purely mechanical, that is, without the assistance of a draftsman — probably every zoologist and paleontologist would obtain this impression upon examing them — are in large part, if one observes them unobtruseively, i.e. without considering their origin, then one involunarily thinks of organic structure, as little as one would initially like to be inclined to such an assumption, and perhaps as much as the text about these figures seems to call for caution because of the too enthusiastic language and bold conclusions.
