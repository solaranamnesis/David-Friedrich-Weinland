### 1882

Shortly before the New Year of 1881, Dr. Otto Hahn in Reutlingen, a lawyer by profession, but also an excellent mineralogist and skilled microscopist, wrote a work entitled "The Meteorite (Chondrite) and its Organisms" with 32 tables of photographic images (Tübingen, H. Laupp) in which he proves that the meteorites, especially the so-called chondrites, contain organic structures that he, without attempting a thorough systematic zoological investigation, generally refers to as sponges, corals, and crinoids.

The forms depicted in the above work are purely mechanical, that is, without the assistance of a draftsman — probably every zoologist and paleontologist would obtain this impression upon examing them — in large part, if one observes them objectively, i.e. without considering their origin, then one involunarily thinks of organic structure, little as one would like to be initially inclined to such an assumption, and perhaps as much as the text regarding these figures seems to call for caution, due to its too enthusiastic language and bold conclusions.

Since some of Hahn's images were near to our interests, because of prior coral studies made about the ocean, we came around to having the relevant cuts themselves transferred for closer inspection. Thereafter, Dr. Hahn provided his entire considerable collection of meteorite cuts, made with great sacrifices of time and money. These cuts, more than six hundred in number, come from eighteen different meteorite falls, mostly duplicates of the Viennese and the extremely rich Tübingen collection. All meteorites are safely certified and belong to falls from Europe, Asia, and America, some of them from the previous century.

An in-depth study of them this past year has provided the following prelimiary results:

1\. The important discovery of Hahn's, great in its consequences, has essentially been confirmed. By far the majority of the forms photographly depicted by Hahn decidedly deal with organic remains, to do with organic structure, indeed, these remains occur in such quantities that some cuts are essentially composed entirely of them for the most part. Well-preserved forms are rare; in the majority it is detritus, large or small, but usually very distinct fragments, the dimensional stability of which can be recognized quite well when one compares many cuts and the mass of the material, as soon as one has familiarized oneself with this strange world of forms, and all the more so as individual pieces have been completely preserved, or even accidentally polished nicely, and can soon be the best possible way to orient us and serve as guiding pieces. However, we expressly state here that the photographic images of Hahn, meritorious as they are, and as much as his above-mentioned work will always remain a foundation, often failed to convey the clarity of the images that we have under the microscope itself.

2\. The organic fragments in the chondrite meteorites are firmly caked and sintered together, much like the organic detritus of corals, sponges, mussels, echinoderms, etc. in the youngest ocean limestone formations of our Earth. These remains in the meteorites are in fact nothing but petrefacts. The petrifying material is usually, but not always, a silicate often bluish or yellow colored. Very frequently they contain black, charred, organic masses, that are punctiform or large in extent. In any case, these forms have not experienced a melting process. The melting produced by friction during the passage of the meteorite through the Earth's atmosphere extends, as already shown, only a few millimeters thick along its surface, thus forming the well-known black fusion crust or glaze. The whole interior of the meteorite, at least in the chondrite meteorites, remains untouched.

3\. By far the majority of the structures contained in the available meteorites can be subordinated to the classes of polycistines, sponges, and foraminifera, although the types are different from the terrestrial ones.

4\. Of coral forms three genera have so far been sufficiently identified, with one so perfectly preserved and displaying the finest microscopic structure that one seldom finds in terrestrial fossils. With one exception, these corals are among the oldest forms encountered on Earth, the Favosites.

5\. Of crinoids three forms, but all are still doubtful.

6\. We have not been able to detect any trace of remains of higher animals: mollusks, arthropods, or even vertebrates.

7\. Also, plant-based remains have not presently been safely proven. But one often encounters scraps of tissue that could well be plant-based.

8\. All the living beings whose remains are embedded in the meteorites we studied, and whose zoological interpretation we have succeeded with thus far, have lived in water and, in accord with their analogously corresponding terrestrial forms, in water that was never allowed to freeze completely.

This situation seems to us to exlude Schiaparelli's recent hypothesis that the meteorites originate from comets or their tails, at least for the chondrite meteorites, provided that constant liquid water on comets cannot be assumed. Or might the comets themselves partially consist of the remnants of shattered planets? (See also 10 below.)

9\. The entire world of forms examined by us in the hundreds of Hahn's cuts, which, based on our prelimiary survey and estimation, may well belong to more than fifty different species of living beings, but of which, since they are usually only preserved as broken structural and fragmented pieces, only a minority can be described precisely, and seem to belong to an early evolution of the living world on the celestial body in question, perhaps even antecedent to the oldest fossils in the most senior layers of our Earth.

10\. The entire animal world of these meteorites at first gives one the impression of an extraordinary smallness of forms in relation to the terrestrial ones. This impression was already provided by Dr. Hahn and could not be avoided at first. In reality, polyp cups with 0.04 mm diameters in terrestrial corals are not yet known (although there are those with 0.5 mm diameters). But we must not draw any conclusions about the tiny nature of this animal world in comparison with the terrestrial one. The size of the polycistine forms, which we recognized as such (and Hahn was inclined to regard as very small crinoids), as well as the foraminifera, agrees quite well with terrestrial ones. Moreover, it should be considered that the often difficult to interpret structural scraps and tissue meshes of all kinds that appear in the meteorites may very well be the remnants of larger (but probably not higher) life forms. So also in the youngest ocean limestone, as it forms our tropical sea coasts, there is found the detritus of crustaceans, echinoderms, corals, polythalamia, etc., larger and better preserved carapaces etc. are always relatively rare, while with the microscope interpretable structural remains of such occur frequently. However, these are more easier to interpret here, since we can readily examine the associated living forms.

11\. The entire world of forms of these meteorites, insofar as we could investigate them, makes the overall impression of a characteristic belonging together. There are cuts of eighteen different meteorite falls, some from the previous century. The same characteristic forms always return, only more or less frequently. The assumption thus seems to us justified for the time being, that all these chondrite meteorites come from a single extraterrestrial celestial body, perhaps a shattered planet, which, in accordance with the analogous construction of its living forms, was probably in its physical, and especially in its atmospheric and thermal conditions, not too dissimilar from our Earth.

We will now try to briefly characterize some of the most notable genera and species, reserving a more comprehensive description with illustrations, especially of the interior structural relations, for those in which there is already a great deal of material.

## I. Gittertierchen "Little Grated Creature", Polycystina.  
### 1. Phormiscus. Nov. gen.  

(_φορμισxος_ = Binsenkörbchen = "Little rush basket".)  

Faceted spheres, consisting of clear glass silica spicules that lay one on top of the other at regular angles like a rush-basket. The spicules are hollow, often furnished with clearly defined longitudinal cavities. Here:

#### _Phormiscus vulgaris. N. sp._
(Image: Hahn, Meteorite, Table. 29, Fig. 2.)  

Diameter of the whole 0.18 mm. Diameter of the spicule joists 0.05 mm. From the meteorite fall of Knyahinya.

These Phormiscus forms are exceptionally common in fragments of the Knyahinya meteorite. There are several types, but the most common one is the one mentioned above, which is immediately recognizable by the thick, clear glass spicule bundles crossed on top of each other at acute angles.

#### _Phormiscus grandis. N. sp._
(Image: Hahn, Meteorite: Table. 29, Fig. 6.)  

More finely woven than the previous type. The spicules cross at more extensive angles.

The best specimens, which were found later and include the inner structure, are not yet pictured. The diameter of one of such is 3.2 mm. So it is a big creature that is rather noticable to the naked eye.

That these _Phormiscus_ belong to the Polycistines seems to us certain. The hollow, partially perforated silica spicules, and particularly the spherical shapes, which is conceivable only in animals moving freely in water, points first of all to this, and not to sponges as one might otherwise think. In any case, however, they form their own family, which we will call Phormiscidae. — They are certainly not crinoids, as Hahn formerly supposed.

### 2. Thyriscus. Nov. gen.  

(θυρις = Fenster = "Window".)

Similarly faceted spheres, consisting of little silica balls, arranged in such a way that they form quadrangular, inwardly tapering funnels like windows or even better, embrasure constructions. The balls are hollow and often furnished with noticeable perforations. Undoubtedly belongs with the family of Phormiscidae.

#### _Thyriscus formosus. N. sp._  
(Hahn: Plate 30, Fig. 3.)  

The diameter of the whole piece shown here is 0.70 mm. Diameter of an entire funnel 0.35 mm. Diameter of the individual balls 0.01 mm. Distance of the holes from each other 0.006 mm. Diameter of the holes 0.001 mm. From the meteorite fall of Knyahinya.

### 3. Goniobrochus. Nov. gen.  

(γωνια = Winkel = "Angle", βρὁχος = Masche = "Mesh".)

We establish this genus on very characteristic structural pieces, which occur frequently in our cuts and one of which has been depicted by Hahn in his meteorite on Table 13, Figure 6. It is a tightly assembled, net-like silica tissue intimately grown together, forming an interrelated pane resembling a small silica ball, whose cross angles overlap to form almost equilateral, quadrilateral meshes. Where these slats cross, hunches arise like a web of knobs. — We can also probably place these structures with the Polycistines, among similar skeletal forms depicted by Häckel in his fine work, "The Radiolarians", on Table 29. The genera Stylodictya and Stylospira, which have very similar knob networks forming their inner skeleton, are particularly worthy of consideration. But one might also think of sponges, such as Scyphia; or of Bryozoa?

#### _Goniobrochus Häckelii. N. sp._  

This form, already depicted by Hahn (see above), comes from the meteorite fall of Cabarras. The available piece appears spread out and fan-shaped in the cut, measuring 0.5 mm crosswise and 0.4 mm in height. The thickness of the little balls is 0.01 mm, the diameter of a stitch is likewise 0.01 mm. The entirety seems to have formed a round pane or perhaps even forming a funnel. We name the species in honor of our former fellow student, the famous founder of the detailed accounts about the great world of these small organisms. 

## II. Sponges and Foraminifera  
### Family: Uranidae. Nov.  

A highly characteristic meteorite type of a lower animal form that occurs very frequently in a wide variety of meteorite falls and — because in the additional excellent cuts we located the best of all meteorites forms — hardly exempting the Hahnia (see below) — can be studied. The same cannot be closely associated with any of the terrestrial animal forms known to us. Whether sponge, whether foraminifera, this question will be difficult to decide, as is well known in some cases of terrestrial fossil forms. Perhaps we are dealing here with an intermediate form.

They are sessile, cushion-shaped colonies with a fine porous lamellar cortex layer and crude, likewise lamellar, lacunae or chambers forming the internal skeleton.

### 1. Urania, Hahn (sensu stricto.).

We adopt in the strict sense the genus name of Hahn, which he had already established in his work "The Primordial Cell", although as a genus of plants, for a very characteristic meteorite form. Since then, in a number of favorable cuts I have been able to study and draw these interesting forms, which in the Knyahinya meteorite are particularly common, so that any doubt about their animal nature, which Hahn later presumed in his meteorite work, can no longer exist. They are always smalt blue and cushion-shaped; the very delicate, finely dashed, velvety looking porous cuticle is probably the peduncle of these sessile colonies. In the cross-section one immediately distinguishes a translucent porous cortex layer. The whole interior of the pillow consists of a rather irregular mesh tissue, which radiates from the cortex towards the center smoothing into lamellar  lineaments, which have lacuna-like cavities or chambers between them.

#### _Urania Salve. N. sp._

This is what we wish to call them, for they are the first greetings of organic forms from another world, the first beings that Hahn recognized as organic, albeit first described as a plant. This species appears both large and small, as entire individuals and as lots of fragments, it is very common in the meteorites, especially those of Knyahinya. Average size 1 mm. Thickness of the always smalt blue cortex 0.04 mm. Hahn shows them many times. The large figure of Table 2, all of the figures of Table 3, then Figures 1, 4, and 6 of Table 4, and Figures 1 and 4 of Table 5 also belong here.

### 2. Pectiscus. Nov. gen.

(πηxτὁς = gekämmt = "Combed".)

Lobate, probably with wide sessile base colonies. They belong to the same family as Urania, to the Uranidae. But the cortex layer here is different, coarse, comb-like, i.e. formed as stronger, more or less radially emanating ribs (lamellae), often reminiscent of the septa of certain coral forms, such as Fungia. But the inner structure, however, as we have in several quite excellent cuts before us (see Figure 1 [magnified 80 times]), consists, as in _Urania_, of a lamellar, chamber-forming tissue that has nothing to do with coral structure. There are a number of species, some of which are apparently quite large, however in the latter only the coarse, inner, chambered mesh-tissue is preserved.

#### _Pectiscus Zittelii. N. sp._

The most common species. Based on its external appearance, its radial rays, and also often by its overall contour, one is often reminded of the familiar scallops (Pecten). But the lobes of these colonies do not maintain a regular overall shape. They are always rounded at the edges, often the edge is divided into smaller lobes by shallow notches. Diameter of the colonies, about 1 to 3 mm. The fine little ribs towards the gray cortex are on average 0.04 mm apart.

Very much widespread in the meteorites, particularly those of Knyahinya and also of Siena. Also, the large structure to which our _Hahnia_ (see below) appears stuck on is such a _Pectiscus_.

In [Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/DFWeinland/fig1.png) [magnified 80 times] we have depicted a small specimen. It comes from the meteorite fall of Iowa and yet provides a clear picture of the internal structure. The outer cortex of the colony at the top and bottom, colored gray here, is preserved. The cut shaved the middle unequally on the two sides; thus, on the lower right one can see the lamellae protruding from the base being quite parallel. In the left half, on the other hand, the cut passed straight through the innermost, mostly irregular, lacuna-like middle layer of the lobe. The entire colony is 1.6 mm long, 1.2 mm wide. — We have a similar, equally instructive cut from Knyahinya.

We permit ourselves to name this species after the gentleman Professor [Karl Alfred von] Zittel, the thorough researcher of fossil sponges.

#### _Pectiscus rudis. N. sp._

A smaller form with even coarser slats.

### 3. Callaion. Nov. gen.

(xάλλαιον = Hahnenkamm = "Cockscomb".)

One of the most remarkable and beautiful constructions in our meteorite fauna. A fine form, like some sinuate cockscombs, reminiscent of some corals (Fungia, Herpetolithus) in its striking habitus, but in accordance with the microscopic construction of its cortex layer it probably belongs with the Uranidae. The thin, outermost layer of the cortex is just as delicately blue-grey, velvety, and even finely striped, as in Urania. In most cuts the raised combs that separate the concavities of the colony from each other, as well as in a fine longitudinal cut in which one can recognize these slight depressions, lie beneath the grey cortex tissue composed of parallel or slightly radiating, very regular lamellae, passing through oblique straps connected to each other and located in the innermost structure that, as we know from Urania and Pectiscus, unfortunately does not show in the best preserved unique specimens, since nowhere does the cut penetrate deep enough. — In this form we are most vividly reminded of the cross-section of Carpenteria Rhaphidodendron, a foraminifera of Mauritius, provided by [Karl August] Möbius in his beautiful treatise on the Eozoon Canadense (Palaeontology XXV, Table 40 Figure 60).

#### _Callaion Paulinianum. N. sp._

Not shown in Hahn's meteorite atlas.

Widest diameter of the little colonies 2.8 mm, the smallest 2 mm.

It presents itself to the naked eye as a grey, mottled speck. The parallel lamellae, appearing as delicate stripes on the bluish surface, are 0.002 mm apart. The proximal, coarser lamellae 0.01 mm. The individual concavities within the colony sometimes appear as elongated troughs 0.06 mm in diameter, sometimes as roundish, or more or less angular, crater-like depressions from 0.05 to 0.3 mm in diameter. Between these ridges, combs run quite like Manicina areolata and many other corals, but of varying width, 0.05 to 0.2 mm in diameter.

The cut comes from the meteorite fall of Iowa (February 1847). Unfortunately, only one specimen is well preserved but we also often encountered rudera of this species in meteorites of Knyahinya.

We permit ourselves to name this species in honor of Miss Pauline Schloz, the meritous sister-in-law of Dr. Hahn, who supported him in the challenging manufacture of many meteorite cuts with the most self-sacrificing devotion.

### 4. Glossiscus. Nov. gen.

(γλῶσσα = Zunge = "Tongue".)

Rounded, tongue-like lobes constructing colonies. The cuticle is composed of hexagonal panels. Pores in the recessed furrows and round, recessed furrows; no trace of radiating ribs as with the Uranidae. Without question belonging to the sponges.
