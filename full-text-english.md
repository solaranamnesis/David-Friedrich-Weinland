### 1882

Shortly before the New Year of 1881, Dr. Otto Hahn in Reutlingen, a lawyer by profession, but also an excellent mineralogist and skilled microscopist, wrote a work entitled "The Meteorite (Chondrite) and its Organisms" with 32 tables of photographic images (Tübingen, H. Laupp) in which he proves that the meteorites, especially the so-called chondrites, contain organic structures that he, without attempting a thorough systematic zoological investigation, generally refers to as sponges, corals, and crinoids.

The forms depicted in the above work are purely mechanical, that is, without the assistance of a draftsman — probably every zoologist and paleontologist would obtain this impression upon examing them — in large part, if one observes them objectively, i.e. without considering their origin, then one involunarily thinks of organic structure, as little as one would like to be initially inclined to such an assumption, and perhaps as much as the text regarding these figures seems to call for caution due to its too enthusiastic language and bold conclusions.

Since some of Hahn's images, because of prior coral studies that were made on the sea, were near to our interests, we came around to transferring the relevant cuts themselves for closer investigation. Thereafter, Dr. Hahn provided his entire considerable collection of meteorite cuts, made with great sacrifices of time and money. These cuts, more than six hundred in number, come from eighteen different meteorite falls, mostly duplicates of the Viennese and the extremely rich Tübingen collection. All meteorites are safely certified and belong to falls from Europe, Asia, and America, some of them from the previous century.

An in-depth study of them this past year has provided the following prelimiary results:

1\. The important discovery of Hahn's, great in its consequences, has essentially been confirmed. By far the majority of the forms photographly depicted by Hahn decidedly deal with organic remains, to do with organic structure, indeed, these remains occur in such quantities that some cuts are essentially composed entirely of them for the most part. Well-preserved forms are rare; in the majority it is detritus, large or small, but usually very distinct fragments, the dimensional stability of which can be recognized quite well when one compares many cuts and the mass of the material, as soon as one has familiarized oneself with this strange world of forms, and all the more so as individual pieces have been completely preserved, or even accidentally polished nicely, and can soon be the best possible way to orient us and serve as guiding pieces. However, we expressly state here that the photographic images of Hahn, meritorious as they are, and as much as his above-mentioned work will always remain a foundation, often failed to convey the clarity of the images that we have under the microscope itself.

2\. The organic fragments in the chondrite meteorites are firmly caked and sintered together, much like the organic detritus of corals, sponges, mussels, echinoderms, etc. in the youngest ocean limestone formations of our Earth. These remains in the meteorites are in fact nothing but petrefacts. The petrifying material is usually, but not always, a silicate often bluish or yellow colored. Very frequently they contain black, charred, organic masses, that are punctiform or large in extent. In any case, these forms have not experienced a melting process. The melting produced by friction during the passage of the meteorite through the Earth's atmosphere extends, as already shown, only a few millimeters thick along its surface, thus forming the well-known black fusion crust or glaze. The whole interior of the meteorite, at least in the chondrite meteorites, remains untouched.

3\. By far the majority of the structures contained in the available meteorites can be subordinated to the classes of polycistines, sponges, and foraminifera, although the types are different from the terrestrial ones.

4\. Of coral forms three genera have so far been sufficiently identified, with one so perfectly preserved and displaying the finest microscopic structure that one seldom finds in terrestrial fossils. With one exception, these corals are among the oldest forms encountered on Earth, the Favosites.

5\. Of crinoids three forms, but all are still doubtful.

6\. We have not been able to detect any trace of remains of higher animals: mollusks, arthropods, or even vertebrates.

7\. Also, plant-based remains have not presently been safely proven. But one often encounters scraps of tissue that could well be plant-based.

8\. All the living beings whose remains are embedded in the meteorites we studied, and whose zoological interpretation we have succeeded with thus far, have lived in water and, in accord with their analogously corresponding terrestrial forms, in water that was never allowed to freeze completely.

This situation seems to us to exlude Schiaparelli's recent hypothesis that the meteorites originate from comets or their tails, at least for the chondrite meteorites, provided that constant liquid water on comets cannot be assumed. Or might the comets themselves partially consist of the remnants of shattered planets? (See also 10 below.)

9\. The entire world of forms examined by us in the hundreds of Hahn's cuts, which, based on our prelimiary survey and estimation, may well belong to more than fifty different species of living beings, but of which, since they are usually only preserved as broken structural and fragmented pieces, only a minority can be described precisely, and seem to belong to an early evolution of the living world on the celestial body in question, perhaps even antecedent to the oldest fossils in the most senior layers of our Earth.

10\. The entire animal world of these meteorites at first gives one the impression of an extraordinary smallness of forms in relation to the terrestrial ones. This impression was already provided by Dr. Hahn and could not be avoided at first. In reality, polyp cups with 0.04 mm diameters in terrestrial corals are not yet known (although there are those with 0.5 mm diameters). But we must not draw any conclusions about the tiny nature of this animal world in comparison with the terrestrial one. The size of the polycistine forms, which we recognized as such (and Hahn was inclined to regard as very small crinoids), as well as the foraminifera, agrees quite well with terrestrial ones. Moreover, it should be considered that the often difficult to interpret structural scraps and tissue meshes of all kinds that appear in the meteorites may very well be the remnants of larger (but probably not higher) life forms. So also in the youngest ocean limestone, as it forms our tropical sea coasts, there is found the detritus of crustaceans, echinoderms, corals, polythalamia, etc., larger and better preserved carapaces etc. are always relatively rare, while with the microscope interpretable structural remains of such occur frequently. However, these are more easier to interpret here, since we can readily examine the associated living forms.

11\. The entire world of forms of these meteorites, insofar as we could investigate them, makes the overall impression of a characteristic belonging together. There are cuts of eighteen different meteorite falls, some from the previous century. The same characteristic forms always return, only more or less frequently. The assumption thus seems to us justified for the time being, that all these chondrite meteorites come from a single extraterrestrial celestial body, perhaps a shattered planet, which, in accordance with the analogous construction of its living forms, was probably in its physical, and especially in its atmospheric and thermal conditions, not too dissimilar from our Earth.

We will now try to briefly characterize some of the most notable genera and species, reserving a more comprehensive description with illustrations, especially of the interior structural relations, for those in which there is already a great deal of material.

## I. Gittertierchen "Little Grated Creature", Polycystina.  
### 1. Phormiscus. Nov. gen.  

(_φορμισxος_ = Binsenkörbchen = "Little rush basket".)  

Faceted spheres, consisting of clear glass silica spicules that lay one on top of the other at regular angles like a rush-basket. The spicules are hollow, often furnished with clearly defined longitudinal cavities. Here:

#### _Phormiscus vulgaris. N. sp._
(Image: Hahn, Meteorite, Table. 29, Fig. 2.)  

Diameter of the whole 0.18 mm. Diameter of the spicule joists 0.05 mm. From the meteorite fall of Knyahinya.

These Phormiscus forms are exceptionally common in fragments of the Knyahinya meteorite. There are several types, but the most common one is the one mentioned above, which is immediately recognizable by the thick, clear glass spicule bundles crossed on top of each other at acute angles.

#### _Phormiscus grandis. N. sp._
(Image: Hahn, Meteorite: Table. 29, Fig. 6.)  

More finely woven than the previous type. The spicules cross at more extensive angles.

The best specimens, which were found later and include the inner structure, are not yet pictured. The diameter of one of such is 3.2 mm. So it is a big creature that is rather noticable to the naked eye.

That these _Phormiscus_ belong to the Polycistines seems to us certain. The hollow, partially perforated silica spicules, and particularly the spherical shapes, which is conceivable only in animals moving freely in water, points first of all to this, and not to sponges as one might otherwise think. In any case, however, they form their own family, which we will call Phormiscidae. — They are certainly not crinoids, as Hahn formerly supposed.

### 2. Thyriscus. Nov. gen.  

(θυρις = Fenster = "Window".)

Similarly faceted spheres, consisting of little silica balls, arranged in such a way that they form quadrangular, inwardly tapering funnels like windows or even better, embrasure constructions. The balls are hollow and often furnished with noticeable perforations. Undoubtedly belongs with the family of Phormiscidae.

#### _Thyriscus formosus. N. sp._  
(Hahn: Plate 30, Fig. 3.)  

The diameter of the whole piece shown here is 0.70 mm. Diameter of an entire funnel 0.35 mm. Diameter of the individual balls 0.01 mm. Distance of the holes from each other 0.006 mm. Diameter of the holes 0.001 mm. From the meteorite fall of Knyahinya.

### 3. Goniobrochus. Nov. gen.  

(γωνια = Winkel = "Angle", βρὁχος = Masche = "Mesh".)

We establish this genus on very characteristic structural pieces, which occur frequently in our cuts and one of which has been depicted by Hahn in his meteorite on Table 13, Figure 6. It is a tightly assembled, net-like silica tissue intimately grown together, forming an interrelated pane resembling a small silica ball, whose cross angles overlap to form almost equilateral, quadrilateral meshes. Where these slats cross, hunches arise like a web of knobs. — We can also probably place these structures with the Polycistines, among similar skeletal forms depicted by Häckel in his fine work, "The Radiolarians", on Table 29. The genera Stylodictya and Stylospira, which have very similar knob networks forming their inner skeleton, are particularly worthy of consideration. But one might also think of sponges, such as Scyphia; or of Bryozoa?

#### _Goniobrochus Häckelii. N. sp._  

This form, already depicted by Hahn (see above), comes from the meteorite fall of Cabarras. The available piece appears spread out and fan-shaped in the cut, measuring 0.5 mm crosswise and 0.4 mm in height. The thickness of the little balls is 0.01 mm, the diameter of a stitch is likewise 0.01 mm. The entirety seems to have formed a round pane or perhaps even forming a funnel. We name the species in honor of our former fellow student, the famous founder of the detailed accounts about the great world of these small organisms. 

## II. Sponges and Foraminifera  
### 1. Family: Uranidae. Nob.  

A highly characteristic meteorite type of a lower animal form that occurs very frequently in a wide variety of meteorite falls and — because in the additional excellent thin sections we located the best of all meteorites forms — hardly exempting the Hahnia (see below) — can be studied. The same cannot be closely associated with any of the terrestrial animal forms known to us. Whether sponge, whether foraminifera, this question will be difficult to decide, as is well known in some cases of terrestrial fossil forms. Perhaps we are dealing here with an intermediate form.

They are sessile, pillow-shaped stumps with a fine porous lamellar cortex layer and crude, likewise lamellar, lacunae or chambers forming the internal skeleton.
