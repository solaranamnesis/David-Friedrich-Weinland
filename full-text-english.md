Shortly before the New Year of 1881, Dr. Otto Hahn in Reutlingen, a lawyer by profession, but also an excellent mineralogist and skilled microscopist, wrote a work entitled "The Meteorite (Chondrite) and its Organisms" with 32 tables of photographic images (Tübingen, H. Laupp) in which he proves that the meteorites, especially the so-called chondrites, contain organic structures that he, without attempting a thorough systematic zoological investigation, generally refers to as sponges, corals, and crinoids.

The forms depicted in the above work are purely mechanical, that is, without the assistance of a draftsman — probably every zoologist and paleontologist would obtain this impression upon examing them — in large part, if one observes them objectively, i.e. without considering their origin, then one involunarily thinks of organic structure, as little as one would like to be initially inclined to such an assumption, and perhaps as much as the text regarding these figures seems to call for caution due to its too enthusiastic language and bold conclusions.

Since some of Hahn's images, because of prior coral studies that were made on the sea, were near to our interests, we came around to transferring the relevant cuts themselves for closer investigation. Thereafter, Dr. Hahn provided his entire considerable collection of meteorite cuts, made with great sacrifices of time and money. These cuts, more than six hundred in number, come from eighteen different meteorite falls, mostly duplicates of the Viennese and the extremely rich Tübingen collection. All meteorites are safely certified and belong to falls from Europe, Asia, and America, some of them from the previous century.

An in-depth study of them this past year has provided the following prelimiary results:

1\. The important discovery of Hahn's, great in its consequences, has essentially been confirmed. By far the majority of the forms photographly depicted by Hahn decidedly deal with organic remains, to do with organic structure, indeed, these remains occur in such quantities that some cuts are essentially composed entirely of them for the most part. Well-preserved forms are rare; in the majority it is detritus, large or small, but usually very distinct fragments, the dimensional stability of which can be recognized quite well when one compares many cuts and the mass of the material, as soon as one has familiarized oneself with this strange world of forms, and all the more so as individual pieces have been completely preserved, or even accidentally polished nicely, and can soon be the best possible way to orient us and serve as guiding pieces. However, we expressly state here that the photographic images of Hahn, meritorious as they are, and as much as his above-mentioned work will always remain a foundation, often failed to convey the clarity of the images that we have under the microscope itself.

2\. The organic fragments in the chondrite meteorites are firmly caked and sintered together, much like the organic detritus of corals, sponges, mussels, echinoderms, etc. in the youngest ocean limestone formations of our Earth. These remains in the meteorites are in fact nothing but petrefacts. The petrifying material is usually, but not always, a silicate often bluish or yellow colored. Very frequently they contain black, charred, organic masses, that are punctiform or large in extent. In any case, these forms have not experienced a melting process. The melting produced by friction during the passage of the meteorite through the Earth's atmosphere extends, as already shown, only a few millimeters thick along its surface, thus forming the well-known black fusion crust or glaze. The whole interior of the meteorite, at least in the chondrite meteorites, remains untouched.

3\. By far the majority of the structures contained in the available meteorites can be subordinated to the classes of polycistines, sponges, and foraminifera, although the types are different from the terrestrial ones.

4\. Of coral forms three genera have so far been sufficiently identified, with one so perfectly preserved and displaying the finest microscopic structure that one seldom finds in terrestrial fossils. With one exception, these corals are among the oldest forms encountered on Earth, the Favosites.

5\. Of crinoids three forms, but all are still doubtful.

6\. We have not been able to detect any trace of remains of higher animals: mollusks, arthropods, or even vertebrates.

7\. Also, plant-based remains have not presently been safely proven. But one often encounters scraps of tissue that could well be plant-based.

8\. All the living beings whose remains are embedded in the meteorites we studied, and whose zoological interpretation we have succeeded with thus far, have lived in water and, in accord with their analogously corresponding terrestrial forms, in water that was never allowed to freeze completely.
